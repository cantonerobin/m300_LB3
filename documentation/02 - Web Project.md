# Web Project
Because we have to address a database this time, I looked for a tutorial using PHP to establish a connection to the database server.

**Die wichtigsten Files sind diese**

- **[index.php](/php/src/index.php)**
The connection to the database is established here.

- **[docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml)**
This file defines our containers.

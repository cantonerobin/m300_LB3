# Overview

## Technologies

## Git
The developer works with Git and pushes his work to GitHub.


## GitHub
In GitHub we will store our code and also run the CI/CD job.
  

## DockerHub
On DockerHub we will store the DockerImage in our own registry. From here we can pull the Image for later steps. 

## Docker
With docker, a containerized environment is made available.


## Apache
Used as a web server.

## PHPMyAdmin
Provided to the developer for easy handling of the database.

## Nginx
Used as a reverse proxy.

## Mysql
This is our database server.

## Vagrant
Vagrant is used to automatically create the VM which is then used as a host for docker.


## Project
As in LB2, I have tried to depict a real use case. This LB3 therefore builds directly on LB2.

**This is an overview of the process.**

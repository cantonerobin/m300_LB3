# Reflection
I enjoyed this assignment, I could combine already known things like Docker with new things like GitHub Actions and Vagrant.
I liked the part, where I created a SQL Script which gets deployed at startup of the container.

## What did I learn.
- Write Dockerfiles which import variables from an .env File.

## What am I satisfied with?
I am satisfied that the whole process works. It's all automated and working.

## What will I do differently next time?
Better plan which features I want to implement.
